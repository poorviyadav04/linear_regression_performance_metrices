# linear_regression_performance_metrices
 Performance Metrics MSE: Average squared error, penalizes larger errors. MAE: Average absolute error, more robust to outliers. R² Score: Measures how well the model explains variance (1 = perfect). Lower MSE/MAE and higher R² indicate better model performance.
